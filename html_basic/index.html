    <h1>Hello, Internet!</h1>
    <h2>This is My First Webpage</h2>
    <h3>Let Me Tell You a Bit About It</h3>

    <p>This is the beginning of my web development journey, and I'm excited to share it with the world.</p>
    <p>HTML is quite fun once you get the hang of it. With just a few tags, I can create structured content!</p>
    <p>In the future, I plan to add styling, interactivity, and even animations. This is just the start.</p>
    <p>Thanks for checking out my page — there's a clickable logo below that takes you somewhere fun!</p>
